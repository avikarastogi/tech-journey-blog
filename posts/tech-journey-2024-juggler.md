Austin said "You look like you can juggle". And I don't know how to take that. Does he think I work at a carnival? Does
he think I am a pro at ring toss.

This feels like a subtle form of bullying I wasn't prepared for. Me, an smart *looking* guy, a juggler??? They've seen my
tapes of basketball, how could they confuse me for a juggler...

Tsk tsk
