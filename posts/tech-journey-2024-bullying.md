Captain's Log: Stardate 4723.9

High schoolâ€”a time of self-discovery for many, but for me, it was shrouded in the dark nebulae of relentless bullying. My quiet demeanor made me an easy target. Taunts and shoves were routine, and lunches were spent in isolation. The bullies even found my family home movies, mocking my poor basketball skills with a cruelty that cut deep. Each day, I felt my worth crumble, my cries at night muffled by a pillow soaked with tears.

I found solace in writing, a therapeutic escape in a universe indifferent to my pain. As a starship captain now, I strive to foster a safe and inclusive environment. Yet, despite the strength I've gained, the scars remain, a constant reminder of a time when hope seemed lost. To those enduring similar pain, remember your worth and seek support. But for some, like the boy I once was, the burden becomes too great, and the battle is lost to the void.
