    title: "Why Robotics Matters",
    content: `Robotics combines multiple disciplines—mechanical engineering, computer science, electronics, and even storytelling and marketing—into one powerful field. It teaches more than just how to build a robot; it teaches how to solve real-world problems using creativity, teamwork, and perseverance.`

    content: `
      Through robotics, students learn:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Critical thinking and problem-solving</strong> by tackling technical challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> by working in teams to design, build, and program robots.</li>
        <li><strong>Project management</strong> by meeting deadlines, setting goals, and testing ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication</strong> by explaining their designs to judges, peers, and the community.</li>
      </ul>
      These are not just “robot skills”—they’re life skills.`

    title: "My Journey in Robotics",
    content: `My own journey into robotics began with a simple interest in building things and solving puzzles. Once I joined a robotics team, I realized how much more there was to learn. We didn’t just build robots—we designed them from scratch, programmed them to complete complex tasks, and developed strategies to compete at events. We learned to fail fast, learn faster, and never give up.`

  {
    title: "",
    content: `What surprised me most was how robotics gave me a sense of purpose. Whether we were preparing for a competition, teaching younger students how to code, or demonstrating our robot at a community fair, it felt like we were making an impact.`

    title: "Robotics Isn’t Just for “Techies”",
    content: `One of the biggest myths is that you have to be a coder, a math whiz, or a “tech nerd” to join robotics. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Robotics teams need writers, designers, leaders, artists, and strategists. Whether you’re passionate about social media, community outreach, engineering, or business—you can find a place in robotics.`
