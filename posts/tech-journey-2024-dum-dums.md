Dum Dums, the popular candy known for its small size and variety of flavors, have a rich history dating back to 1924
when the Spangler Candy Company was founded in Ohio, USA. The idea for Dum Dums came about in 1953 as a way to use up
the candy mixture left in the kettles used for larger candy production. Named after a popular phrase of the time, "Dum
Dums" (meaning "silent") were initially simple, round lollipops with a paper label and became known for their unique
mystery flavor. Over the decades, they've evolved to include over 16 flavors and remain a beloved treat worldwide, known
for their consistent quality and nostalgic appeal.
